	<h2 class="centre">What Is Sustainable Living</h2>
	<p>Sustainable living means to make lifestyle choices that reduce the impact on the environment.Those who live sustainability usually are aiming towards reducing their carbon footprint and conserve natural resources.<br><br>Sustainable living means understanding how our lifestyle choices impact the world around us and finding ways for everyone to live better and lighter. Applying a ‘people lens’ to sustainability is new, timely and opportunities are great.

<div id="Differences">
	<h2 class="center">Differences of Sustainable Living from Unsustainable Living</h2>
	<p>Sustainable development is the type of development that satisfies the current needs of the society without interfering with “the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs”. On the contrary, unsustainable development does not consider the future generations, or their needs.</p>
</div>
<div id="Start">
	<h2 class="center">How to start sustainable living</h2>
	<p>There are numerous ways to start living more sustainably — and a sustainable lifestyle looks different for everyone. Areas where you can reduce your impact include:</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>
				Eating a plant based diet
			</th>
			<th>
				Composting
			</th>
			<th>
				Reducing single-use plastic
			</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<p>A plant-based diet reduces your carbon footprint because of the massive amount of natural resources needed to make animal products.</p>
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>Compositing helps the environment by reducing erosion and establishing vegetation.</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Reducing single-use plastic protects our wildlife and reduce the toxicity in our air and water.</p>	
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Transportation</th>
			<th>Shopping</th>
		</tr>
        <tr>
        	<td><p>Using an electric car or hybrid reduces carbon emissions. It can also help you save money because you do not have to buy petrol.</p></td>
        
        
        	<td><p>Shopping sustainably can make a huge imapct on the environment.First of all, you should bring your own bag instead of using a plastic bag. Second,buying in bulk can help because it generates less waste then buying individual products.</p></td>

<div id="Impact">
	<h2 class="center">Impact of Sustainable Living</h2>
	<p>The average American produces 4.4 pounds of trash per day, according to the EPA — that comes out to more than 1,600 pounds per year. So by transitioning to a zero-waste lifestyle, you could literally save thousands of pounds of trash from going to landfills, where it would emit harmful greenhouse gases. </p>
<p>By eating a vegan or plant-based diet, every year, you can save: 401,500 gallons of water, 14,600 pounds of grain; 10,950 square feet of forest, 7,300 pounds of CO2, and 365 animal lives, according to the Vegan Calculator. </p>
<p>While it may seem like small changes such as going zero-waste or vegan won’t really make a difference, looking at those statistics make it clear that sustainability lifestyle changes can be powerful. </p>

<div id="People">
	<h2 class="center">What People Can Do</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<h3> Grow Food </h3>
			<p>Growing some of your own food. Start a vegetable or herb garden, and plant a fruit tree or even two. This will save tonnes of transport greenhouse gases because the food will be right outside your door. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3> Preserve Food </h3>
			<p>Did you know that preserving food by pickling, drying or bottling is better than freezing in a refrigerator.Why? Because it uses less energy than the refrigerator. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3> Reduce Waste </h3>
			<p>Gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are released into the atmosphere from waste disposal sites. This adds to the greenhouse effect and global warming. Dangerous materials also leaking from rubbish dumps and pollute waterways and soil from rubbish dumps.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3> Insulate Houses</h3>
			<p>Insulate houses to reduce the amount of energy needed to heat and cool the house. Trees planted around the house will shade it during hot weather. Some people are covering roofs with living plants to stop the house warming or cooling too quickly.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3> Use Public Transport</h3>
			<p>Use public transport whenever you can to reduce the amount of gases from petrol powered cars. Ride your bike!</p>
